- Toss decision distribution (Pie Chart)
- Match outcome (Chasing vs Defending) (Pie Chart)
- Top scorers and their high scores (Bar Chart)
- Player of the Match frequency (Bar Chart)
- Best bowling figures (Bar Chart)
- Venue-wise scores and wickets (Grouped Bar Charts)

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly Express & Graph Objects
- CSV (Data Source)
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The actual IPL 2022 dataset (`IPL2022_Data.csv`) is not included due to source restrictions. You can add your own structured IPL 2022 dataset to run the visualizations.
